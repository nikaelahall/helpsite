				<h4>VMWare View Client</h4>
				<p>
				The VMWare View client allows you to log in to the desktop you see on the Polytech PC's
				from your own machine over the internet. There are two desktops available - the standard Polytech desktop and one set up for ICT students which has some programming software, including Visual Studio 2013, installed onto it. 
				You have access to everything as normal, but most importantly your H: drive. 
				You can copy and paste files between your own pc and drives at Polytech allowing easy sending
				of your work and submitting of assessments.
				</p>
				<p>
				We don't support local mode so don't bother downloading the local mode
				client. You may be tempted to log in to View, log into the ICT Desktop, and then fire up Visual Studio and start coding.
				We do not recommend this. It will be very slow and a loss of connection *may* cause you to lose work. Always work in locally installed applications and copy your work over when done.

			<div id='silence'>
				<h4>Silence Your Devices</h4>
				<p>
					Having your phone ring or your laptop start blasting out sound from a flash advertisement during class is embarrassing. 
					Keep your laptop on mute until you actually need audio, go into your windows sound settings and disable your startup, logon and shutdown sounds etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					On your mobile there are plenty of apps to automate silencing your phone based on: your location, nearby wi-fi, timetable, 
					calendar or whatever works for you. If you are rocking Android then I recommend the app called <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gabrielittner.timetable&hl=en'>Timetable</a>. It is fantastic at
					what it does and has a great feature for muting your phone when you are in a class.

			<div id='idrive'>
				<h4>The I: Drive</h4>
				<p>
				The I: drive contains course materials provided by your lecturer often including the Powerpoints. Make sure you are regularly 
				checking it as they add content as the semester progresses. Take a copy of the folder for each of your classes home on a USB 
				so you have the materials when you need them.
				You can also copy stuff via the View client but this can be slower.
				</P>
				<p>
				The path you probably need is: I:\COURSES\EAD\AITEIT3\BITY1

			<div id='organise'>
				<h4>Organise Your H: Drive</h4>
				<p>
				Make a sensible folder structure to store your work so that you can manage it easily and find your work again. Make sure you have a folder for each paper you take and keep everything related inside, this makes your backup easier. Name your folders for exercises sensibly, a bunch of folders named Lab1 doesn't tell you much. This may sound like common sense but you would be surprised	how many people don't do this.

			<div id='backup'>
				<h4>Backup Your Work</h4>
				<p>
				Maintain regular backups of your work! Saying "I can't hand in my assignment because my HDD crashed" won't get you any marks. Basic 
				methods include making a copy on a USB drive or uploading to a cloud service like Dropbox or similar. While these work they may not 
				be the best methods when it comes to code.
				</p>
				<p>
				When it comes to code, in the long run you will need to be using some kind of version control system, so why not get used to it now?
				You have options like GitHub provided online, and the IT Department runs an SVN server. There are instructions for using SVN with 
				the TortoiseSVN client. If you have problems with SVN or find that you have not been added to the server you should contact either
				Perrin or Krissi.

				<h4>Use The Common Room</h4>
				<p>
				The common room D209 is a good place to go between classes. It is a space to do work and discuss it as well as socialise with your classmates. There are 5 PC's for student use that have recently been upgraded as well as space for laptops.

			<div id='facebook'>
				<h4>Join the Facebook groups</h4>
				<p>
				The BIT Home, CITSS Home and CIT Home Facebook groups are used by staff and students alike to post news, updates about classes and assignments, useful links and information. Because everyone is in the group a really handy bonus is that you can ask for help any time of the day and you almost always get a prompt response from somebody.

				<h4>After Hours Access</h4>

				You can get your student ID enabled for after hours access to some rooms in D block. If you have work to complete often you will be more productive at Polytech than at home so you should consider working here. Register your ID for access at the link below.

				<h4>Free Software</h4>
				<p>
				As a student you get access to free software from Microsoft and VMWare. The MSDNAA and VMWare web stores give you access to product keys and downloads of the ISO files containing the software. If you don't want to download all that data the ISO's are also available on the L: Software drive. You can simply copy the files onto a USB drive on a Polytech PC and take them home. It's free so why not use it?

			<div id='communicate'>
				<h4>Communicate With Your Lecturers</h4>
				<p>
				If for any reason you can't come to class, maybe you're sick, injured, going through a tough time or are getting behind in your work for some reason then the most important thing to do is tell your lecturers! They can help, they do understand, but they need to know what's going on.

			<div id='textbooks'>
				<h4>Textbooks</h4>
				<p>
				When you are writing code a good language reference manual is indispensable. While a hard copy is great they can be quite expensive. Luckily for poor students like us many of our textbooks are available as PDF's. These are often cheaper than the hard copies and also present other benefits such as being searchable and being very light weight. 	
				</P>
				<p>
				Many textbooks are available in Bill Robertson Library in hard copy form. The Library also maintains a subscription to <td><a href='http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/'>Safari Books Online</a></td> allowing access to a selection of ebooks from any on-campus machine, or via ViewClient from off-campus.

			<div id='comment'>
				<h4>Comment Your Code</h4>
				<p>
				Pseudo-coding and then commenting your code feels laborious and pointless at first and you will be tempted to not bother. Trust me, get in the habit of doing it now so that it becomes second nature. While it seems unnecessary for the simple programs you start with, your programs won't always be so simple, and good planning is key to successful coding. On top of that there are two important reasons to comment, firstly you may think you will be able to read your code later and remember how it works and what it does, but you won't. Secondly you may not be the only person working with your code. Those other people (teachers, team members etc.) sadly can't read your mind so they need your comments to help understand your code. So just comment your code.

			<div id='googling'>
				<h4>A Note On Googling</h4>
				<p>
				Google is a great resource and can quickly help you find solutions to some niggling code problems, but be careful. Like everything you read on the internet take coding advice with a grain of salt. The internet is a crazy place and they'll let anybody on there, even those people who want to give advice but really don't know what they're talking about. Textbooks are peer reviewed publications and as such are far less likely to put you wrong or teach you bad habits.
				</P>
				<p>
				Also remember the three key points if you are doing research online for school work. Reference your sources. Don't reference Wikipedia, that doesn't count, investigate their sources instead. Never just copy and paste web content into your assignment, that's plagiarism folks.
