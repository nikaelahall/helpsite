					<h3 id="idriveJump">I:/ Drive</h3>
					<hr>
					<p class="text">The I: drive contains course materials provided by your lecturer often including the Powerpoints. Make sure you are regularly checking it as they add content as the semester progresses. Take a copy of the folder for each of your classes home on a USB so you have the materials when you need them. You can also copy stuff via the View client but this can be slower.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="text">The path you need is: I:\COURSES\EAD\AITEIT3\...</p>

					<h3 id="softwareJump">Software</h3>
					<hr>
					<p class="text">As a student you get access to free software from Microsoft and VMWare. The MSDNAA and VMWare web stores give you access to product keys and downloads of the ISO files containing the software. If you don't want to download all that data the ISO's are also available on the L: Software drive. You can simply copy the files onto a USB drive on a Polytech PC and take them home. It's free so why not use it?</p>

They can help, they do understand, but they need to know what's going on.</p>
