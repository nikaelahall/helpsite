				<!-- I Drive -->
				<h3 id="idriveJump">I:/ Drive</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>The I: drive contains course materials provided by your lecturer often including the Powerpoints. Make sure you are regularly checking it as they add content as the semester progresses. Take a copy of the folder for each of your classes home on a USB so you have the materials when you need them. You can also copy stuff via the View client but this can be slower.</p>

				<p>The path you need is: I:\COURSES\EAD\AITEIT3\...</p>

				<h4>Organise Your H: Drive</h4>
				<p>Make a sensible folder structure to store your work so that you can manage it easily and find your work again. Make sure you have a folder for each paper you take and keep everything related inside, this makes your backup easier. Name your folders for exercises sensibly, a bunch of folders named Lab1 doesn't tell you much. This may sound like common sense but you would be surprised how many people don't do this.</p>

				<!-- Software -->
				<h3 id="softwareJump">Software</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>As a student you get access to free software from Microsoft and VMWare. The MSDNAA and VMWare web stores give you access to product keys and downloads of the ISO files containing the software. If you don't want to download all that data the ISO's are also available on the L: Software drive. You can simply copy the files onto a USB drive on a Polytech PC and take them home. It's free so why not use it?</p>

				<h4>VMWare View Client</h4>

				<p>The VMWare View client allows you to log in to the desktop you see on the Polytech PC's from your own machine over the internet. There are two desktops available - the standard Polytech desktop and one set up for ICT students which has some programming software, including Visual Studio 2013, installed onto it. You have access to everything as normal, but most importantly your H: drive. You can copy and paste files between your own pc and drives at Polytech allowing easy sending of your work and submitting of assessments.</p>
				<p>We don't support local mode so don't bother downloading the local mode client. You may be tempted to log in to View, log into the ICT Desktop, and then fire up Visual Studio and start coding. We do not recommend this. It will be very slow and a loss of connection *may* cause you to lose work. Always work in locally installed applications and copy your work over when done.</p>

				<h4>Communicate With Your Lecturers</h4>
				<p>If for any reason you can't come to class, maybe you're sick, injured, going through a tough time or are getting behind in your work for some reason then the most important thing to do is tell your lecturers! They can help, they do understand, but they need to know what's going on.</p>

				<h4>Join the Facebook groups</h4>
				<p>The BIT Home, CITSS Home and CIT Home Facebook groups are used by staff and students alike to post news, updates about classes and assignments, useful links and information. Because everyone is in the group a really handy bonus is that you can ask for help any time of the day and you almost always get a prompt response from somebody.</p>
