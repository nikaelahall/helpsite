				<h3>WiFi</h3>
				<hr>
				<p class="text">The wireless network provided for students is OP-Student. Once you are connected to this network you will be automatically redirected to a login portal. If you are not automatically redirected you can manually enter the address 1.1.2.1 in your browser. Once you have logged in using your polytech credentials you can browse as you would normally.

				<h3>I:/ Drive</h3>
				<hr>
				<p class="text">The I: drive contains course materials provided by your lecturer often including the Powerpoints. Make sure you are regularly checking it as they add content as the semester progresses. Take a copy of the folder for each of your classes home on a USB so you have the materials when you need them. You can also copy stuff via the View client but this can be slower.

				<h3>Software</h3>
				<hr>
				<p class="text">As a student you get access to free software from Microsoft and VMWare. The MSDNAA and VMWare web stores give you access to product keys and downloads of the ISO files containing the software. If you don't want to download all that data the ISO's are also available on the L: Software drive. You can simply copy the files onto a USB drive on a Polytech PC and take them home. It's free so why not use it?

				Communicate With Your Lecturers
				<br>
				If for any reason you can't come to class, maybe you're sick, injured, going through a tough time or are getting behind in your work for some reason then the most important thing to do is tell your lecturers! They can help, they do understand, but they need to know what's going on.
